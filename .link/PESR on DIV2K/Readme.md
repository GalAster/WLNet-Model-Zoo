### Remark

> **@GalAster:**
> There are two models in official repo.
> PSNR-Optimized Model and Perception-Optimized Model.
> I checked the **PSNR-Optimized Model** and think that almost the same as **EDSR4x**.
> So I only convert the Perception-Optimized one.
> And the script also works on another one in fact.
