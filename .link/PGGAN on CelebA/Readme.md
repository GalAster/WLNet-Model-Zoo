### Remark

> **@GalAster:**
> I removed `ScaledConvolution` or so called  `WScaleLayer`, which means scaled the weights to `1/sqrt(channal)`.
> And I use normal `ConvolutionLayer`.
> I also tried to export full net with all resolutions but failed.

> **@GalAster:**
> A word of caution: Do not store high-definition pictures in your notebook!
